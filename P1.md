# CSC 4730 Project 1

Fork, exec, pipes and redirection

## Objectives

You will master several key operating systems services. These are:

•	fork		how new processes are created

•	exec		how new programs are loaded

•	pipe		a means of interprocess communication

•	redirection	how standard input and output(s) can be manipulated

## Deadlines

You have 9 calendar days to complete this assignment. You should aim to complete it in 7 so that this project does not overlap with your next assignment.

A ten percent penalty will be assigned if one day late.

A twenty percent penalty will be assigned if two days late.

Beyond two days late, no project will be accepted.

## Overview

Rather than build a simple shell utilizing a shell-like command syntax, you will use command line options. For example:

```$ myshell -d /bin -1 ls -2 wc -o /tmp/output.txt```

This command line will run the program ls piping its output to wc which writes its standard output into /tmp/output.txt. The directory in which these commands should execute is /bin. 

In a real shell the above command line would look like this:

```$ pushd /bin; ls | wc > /tmp/output.txt; popd```

Coding this project using real shell syntax would mean many hours of your time would be devoted to parsing 
the shell syntax and not learning operating system froodiness.

## Required command line options

Command line options can occur in any order. You must *implement* the following:

```-d``` followed by a path to a directory - the command or sequence of commands should start in the named directory. It is an error if the directory does not exist or the path does not lead to a directory. If this option is not present, the current working directory is unchanged.

```-i``` followed by a path to a file - this file will be wired into the standard input of the first program in the sequence. This is optional. If not given, the standard input is left alone. It is an error if the file path is not valid or the file fails to open. This is the real shell equivalent of ‘<’.

```-o``` followed by a path to a file - this file will be wired into the standard output of whatever program is last in the sequence. This is optional. If not given, the standard output is left alone. It is an error if the file path is not valid or the file fails to open. The file is opened in overwrite mode. Be careful. This is the real shell equivalent of ‘>’.

```-a```	followed by a path to a file - this file will be wired into the standard output of whatever program is last in the sequence. This is optional. If not given, the standard output is left alone. It is an error if the file path is not valid or the file fails to open. This differs from -o in that the file is to be opened in append mode. This is the real shell equivalent of ‘>>’.

*NOTE: if both -o and -a are given, whichever comes last takes precedence.*

```-1```	followed by a path of a program to run. This **must** be provided. It is an error if the path does not lead to an executable program.

```-2```	followed by a path of a program to run. This is optional. If given, it receives its input from a pipe from the preceding program. It is an error if the path does not lead to an executable program.

```-p```	this command line option does not take an argument. It is optional. If given, it prints the current working directory. See the getcwd function.

## Optional command line options

```-v```	this command line option does not take an argument. It is optional. If given, it turns on any additional debugging print out you might want. I will not test this and you are not required to implement it.

## Mode of operation

If more than one executable program is specified, your program must use the pipe system call to wire together standard out of the first program to the standard in of the second. 

Your program must use fork and some variety of exec (specifically execvp) appropriately either one or two times.

Your program must correctly wire up the standard input of the first executable program if requested.

Your program must correctly wire up the standard output of the last executable program if requested.

Your program must wait for the programs you’ve run to exit and print their return codes.

```

Nothing in this specification says you must pass custom command line arguments to either program 1 or program 2. You are not to do so however you must correctly pass a minimal argc and argv.

## Hint

In a standard shell, execute

```sleep 1 | sleep 1 | sleep 1 | sleep 1 | ps -l```

(the last command is ps dash lowercase L).

Examine the process ID columns and parent process ID columns. This may suggest to you how to structure your code governing who forks who. *To put the potato on the fork, this is wrong: parent forks child 1 - child 1 forks child 2.*

## Hint

You'll need to use at least these system calls:

```
fork
execvp
pipe
dup and / or dup2
close
open
getcwd
```

You will need to use:

```
getopt
```


## What to Hand In

Zip your makefile and all of your .c and / or .cpp source files and any header files into a single zip file containing NO subfolders. If your zip file contains a subfolder, I will remove 5 points.

## Partners

Only 1 person should hand in code. The code should clearly state who the partners are in a comment at the top of the main source file.

The non-code-submitting partner must submit a text file “partner.txt” that states who the partners are.

Failure to list partners correctly as described above removes 5 points from your grade.

## Grading

The class will receive a rubric when grading is complete that describes errors and penalties.

Both partners get the same grade without exception.

# Academic Honesty Concern

Placing your code in a public place like a public github can lead to cheating which YOU can be held accountable for. Also, do not consult places like github. I can download any previous implementation of this project at any time and check for plagiarism. I would rather not and you won’t learn anything by copying.
